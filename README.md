# Gradio_ML_WebApp
Gradio allows you to quickly create customizable UI components around your TensorFlow or PyTorch models, or even arbitrary Python functions. Mix and match components to support any combination of inputs and outputs. Our core library is free and open-source!
Here i actually worked on a basic linear regression model which is iris data classification.

If you see above image i've created a GUI interface for checking my results with Gradio. So,basically Gradio is simple and easy for ML models to check our model performance.
